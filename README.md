Instructions
1/ Write a Python class named Point3D defined by x, y, and z. Define a method that returns (x, y ,z). This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: 
(x, y, z). Then create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3 and print it.
2/ Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width. Define two methods, area and perimeter, which will compute the area and the
perimeter of the rectangle. Then create a variable named my_rectangle containing a new instance of Rectangle with width=3 and length = 4 and compute both
area and perimeter ( the area is expected to be 3*4=12 and perimeter 2*(3+4)=14).
3/ Define a Car class. The car should have attributes for color and mileage. The car should also have two methods: one to display its attributes and another to drive the car (which increases its mileage).
4/  Extend the previous Car class to create an ElectricCar class. An electric car should have an additional attribute called battery_level which starts at 100%. Define a method charge to fully charge the battery and override the drive method such that every 1 mile driven reduces the battery level by 1%.
